I suck, I am bad at everything. I am a total failure. I am a loser. I am unintelligent, poor, dumb, broke, and stupid as fuck. I am a huge honk of shit waiting to be throw into the gargabe disposal (p.s. who throws shit into gargabe disposal?)..., um..., waiting to be flush down the toilet. Well, you get the point, I am shit at any given aspects of life. My very own existence is utterly meaningless. My worth is not even close to the worth of oxygen I enhaled. I am just a huge big of human meat, wainting for my heart to stop beating, and turn to ashes, and stuffed in a coffin 6 feet underground. Hello and welcome. Nice to meet you. I am Sean.
